Tikva only exists because of Piercy’s yearning for a place of acceptance and inclusion, desires that Ito does not feel and therefore he does not express in his work, Ghost in the Shell. How

 the idea of a human soul from the body. This complicates matters, undeniably, Yod feels emotions, but are the equivalent to human emotions as valid as actual human emotions. Perhaps, this
feeling is a universal human attitude, one does not have to be “human” simply they must be “human enough”.

The cyberpunk universe in Marge Piercy’s He, She and It and in Kazunori Ito’s Ghost in the Shell (1995) display clear divergences that stem from the creators regional and developmental back
grounds. Again, the contrast between the two pieces comes from the level of oppression and fear for the future that Piercy feels that Ito does not. Tikva only exists because of Piercy’s yea
rning for a place of acceptance and inclusion, desires that Ito does not feel and therefore he does not express in his work, Ghost in the Shell. However, only Piercy discusses her fears of
